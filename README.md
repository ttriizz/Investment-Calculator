# Investment-Calculator
Investment calculator program


1. Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
This is an investment calculator program, it solves the mathematical functions of calculating investment returns over a number of years along with the possibility of monthly contributions. 


2. What did you do particularly well?
I find the mathematical functions to be very efficient in finding the returns. I did spend some time in figuring out what equations would work best for this application.



3. Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I think the display coding could be more efficient, I noticed when my return digits get over 7 it scoots my total number over a couple of spaces.


4. Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
The display table formating was the most difficult thing for me. It took a lot of going back and re-reading formating code chapters and watching youtube videos to figure it out.


5. What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
Formating for starters, this project taught me a lot on how formatting works and how to make it work for you. I also feel like the mathematical equations used in this program will transfer to others.


6. How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable? 
By not only being mindful of whitespace, but also the structuring Ive implemented is very easy to read and follow through. I structured it so that looking at the code almost will show how it appears on display which makes formatting, and add/removing features simple.
